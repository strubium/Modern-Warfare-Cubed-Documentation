# Project Resources

These are essential resources for collaboration on our project. Here's a breakdown of each resource:

## Modding Guides and References

- **[Cleanroom Wiki]:** Our primary source of up-to-date information on 1.12 modding. It's not fully complete, but it is the most current resource available.

- **[Forge Documentation]:** This is an additional source for 1.12 modding. It's more comprehensive than the [Cleanroom Wiki] but less up-to-date. **Always consult the [Cleanroom Wiki] first before referring to the [Forge Documentation].**

- **[Documentation on Making Content for VM 3.0 (Outdated and Incomplete)]:** This document contains historical information for creating content for VM 3.0. Use it for reference on past practices.

[Cleanroom Wiki]: https://cleanroommc.com/wiki/
[Forge Documentation]: https://docs.minecraftforge.net/en/1.12.x/
[Documentation on Making Content for VM 3.0 (Outdated and Incomplete)]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z-Cmo5G1Eh8tHSid2nMXDQaBgLqsQktg-heSHn2EPBY/edit?usp=sharing

## Community and Collaboration

- **[Cleanroom Discord]:** A crucial community resource for assistance. Make sure to try finding a solution on your own before reaching out.

- **[Modern Warfare Cubed Discord]:** If you aren't in it already, the Modern Warfare Cubed Discord allows you to speak directly to the devs and collaborate more effectively.

- **[Contributing Guide]:** Before you start contributing, make sure to read this guide. It'll help you understand our contribution policies and procedures.

- **[Trello Board]:** Our project management tool. You can use it to see what others are working on, track your own tasks, and identify new tasks to pick up. (If you are not a member of the board and you want to be one contact me in DM's)
